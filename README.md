## What is RedCircle?

RedCircle is a decentralized platform that converts Reddit posts into **SPL tokens** on the Solana blockchain. Users can tokenize viral content, buy/sell tokens, and speculate on cultural impact.

**Think of it as:** A stock market for memes and viral content.

### The Problem
- Content creators can't monetize viral posts
- Social media engagement has no tangible value
- No way to invest in content you believe will trend

### Our Solution
- **Tokenize** any Reddit post as an SPL token on Solana
- **Trade** tokens based on predicted virality
- **Earn** from early investments in trending content
- All transactions verified on blockchain

## How It Works

### Create a Token

```
1. Find a Reddit post you think will go viral
2. Enter the post URL on RedCircle
3. Set token supply and initial price
4. Platform mints SPL token on Solana blockchain
5. Token is now tradable
```

**On-Chain:**
- Creates unique token mint address on Solana
- Mints specified supply to platform wallet
- Token becomes tradable immediately

**How Trading Works:**

**Buying:**
- User pays SOL → receives tokens
- Price increases as more people buy
- Early buyers get lowest prices

**Selling:**
- User sends tokens → receives SOL (minus 5% fee)
- Price decreases as tokens are sold back
- Platform provides instant liquidity

**Example:**
```
Token: POST123 (1M supply, 0.001 SOL initial price)

Day 1: Sam buys 10,000 tokens @ 0.001 = 10 SOL
Day 2: Post goes viral, 500K tokens sold
       Price now: 0.00225 SOL
Day 3: Sam sells @ 0.00225 = 21.4 SOL
       Profit: 114% in 2 days
```
